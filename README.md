<h3>JavaTeX</h3>

You can find this project [here](https://github.com/keithallatt/JavaTeX/blob/main/README.md)!

While this project is still a work in progress, it aims to bring easy, repeatable, and modular LaTeX document generation to people too busy to manually create large documents that follow a set pattern. The end goal of this project is to have a wide variety of preset document chunks, which can be edited through the graphical user interface, and to generate similar documents with slightly different values (like for worksheets or written test versions).
