### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Keith and I'm a casual software developer. I study computer science and mathematics, and love to learn! Here you can find most of my pet projects, and even some school projects that required a GitHub account! Please take a look around and feel free to explore my code!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the JavaTeX repo!
  - If you want to give me any suggestions, please go to the Issues tab or make a Pull request!
- âš¡ Fun fact: The Python Language got it's name from the British comedy troupe Monty Python!
