## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Keith and I'm a casual software developer. I study computer science and mathematics, and love to learn! Here you can find most of my pet projects, and even some school projects that required a GitHub account! Please take a look around and feel free to explore my code!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the LaTeXWorkSheets repo!
  - If you want to give me any suggestions, please go to the Issues tab or make a Pull request!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/They
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new packages or libraries! 
  - I'm primarily a back-end developer, so these projects are where my skills shine!
  - If you think you can teach me something cool about UI design or UI experience, please reach out!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Check out my LinkedIn or send me an email!
  - All emails asking me to star a repo or other similar spam-ish emails will be ignored.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The Python Language got it's name from the British comedy troupe Monty Python!

### Check out some of my projects!

  <summary>CustomIDE</summary>
  
  <br />

  You can find this project [here](https://github.com/keithallatt/CustomIDE/blob/main/README.md)!

  This project is all about the process of developing an in-house, fully custom IDE for Python! The goal of this project is not to switch daily-drivers to a new IDE, but to explore how IDE's are put together, from the stylistic choices, to the integrated tools and how each piece fits together. 
  
  A benefit to this project is doing it all in Python. The IDE is written in Python, using the PyQt5 module, making reading the code easier while still accomplishing a lot. In the future I'd like to try developing a plugin that allows for Java applications to be run also.

  <summary>JavaTeX</summary>
  
  <br />

  You can find this project [here](https://github.com/keithallatt/JavaTeX/blob/main/README.md)!

  While this project is still a work in progress, it aims to bring easy, repeatable, and modular LaTeX document generation to people too busy to manually create large documents that follow a set pattern. The end goal of this project is to have a wide variety of preset document chunks, which can be edited through the graphical user interface, and to generate similar documents with slightly different values (like for worksheets or written test versions).

  <summary>GameTools</summary>
  
  <br />
  
  You can find this project [here](https://github.com/keithallatt/GameTools/blob/main/README.md)
  
  This project is still a work in progress, but aims to create a python library of modules to use in game prototyping, allowing creators to create inventory systems, simple maps, a rudimentary gameplay routine, etcetera. The end goal of this project is to have developing a small simple game be easy enough that a Python newbie could create something they could be proud of in a reasonable number of lines of code. A lot of the tools don't depend on packages such as the `curses` package, but instead can be used as the backend to a PyGame application.

  <summary>Logic</summary>
  
  <br />

  You can find this project [here](https://github.com/keithallatt/Logic/blob/main/README.md)!

  This project is all about programming logical structures. Currently focusing on Propositional Logic, also known as Zero-th order logic.
